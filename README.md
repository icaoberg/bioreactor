Membrane-coupled bioreactors (MBRs) are advantageous for
wastewater treatment because they are capable of retaining 100%
of bacterial cells. This research aims to establish a mathematical
model to describe the cell biomass growth and substrate removal
processes in a MBRs. The mathematical expressions for change in
the biomass are presented and combined with a substrate removal
process to describe the bacterial growth rate. We discuss the
stability of the equilibria for the biomass growth as a function
of the rate of growth ($\mu_{max}$), decay ($K_d$), saturation
($K_s$), and yield ($\eta$) constants.
